BOSS: Unfortunately, Edna didn't end up being a great fit. We're a family here, and like many families, we've had to make the difficult decision to cut ties with a poorly-performing relative who does not help us meet our objectives at this time.
BOSS: In one sense, I owe you an apology. 

BOSS: I hired a loser. I've exhibited that tendency in the past, and in many cases we're still living with the effects of those mistakes. 

BOSS: This doesn't entirely absolve me of blame, but to be fair to myself I should note that many of our applicants are among the most worthless our society has to offer.
BOSS: In any case, you won't have to pay the price for Edna's inadequacy and pick up her slack today. I've brought in Patricia, my neice, to help out. Everyone, welcome Patricia.
TRIGGER_SYNC: patricia-enter
BOSS: Also, I have some good news! We changed suppliers for our bottles to save some cash, but we now have to sanitize the bottles before filling. 
BOSS: First, press and hold {left_btn} to charge the sanitizer. Then, when bottles are in the first zone on your left, press {left_btn} again to sanitize all of the ones in that zone.
BOSS: You'll figure it out.

YOU: I know, and I'm not even sure what happened. She was supposed to be getting out early to pick up her brother. And then she just... stayed in the boss's office?

HELENA: I feel like this is worse than a firing. I wouldn't put any depraved shit past the boss. Damn it, we didn't even get her number yesterday.

    * [Go ask] YOU: Why don't you go ask? Say she left something with you and you need to get in touch with her.
    HELENA: You're right. We can at least get her side of it.
